# **Feature Descriptions**

## **1. Location Input and Current Weather Display**

### **Feature Overview**

Users should be able to input a location (city name, zip code, or latitude/longitude coordinates) to retrieve and view current weather conditions. The system will convert location names to geographic coordinates using Nominatim when needed and fetch weather data from Open-Meteo.

### **User Story**

**Title:** As a user, I want to enter a location and see current weather conditions.

**Description:**  
I want to input my location (by city name, zip code) and immediately see the current weather conditions so I can make informed decisions about my day.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The input field accepts city names, zip codes.
- The system validates inputs and shows appropriate error messages for invalid entries.
- For city names and zip codes, the system uses Nominatim to convert to coordinates.
- After valid input, the system displays current weather information including:
  - Temperature (actual and "feels like")
  - Weather condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
  - Humidity percentage
  - Wind speed and direction
  - UV index
  - Precipitation (if applicable)
- The system handles and displays appropriate messages for API errors.
- The system shows a loading indicator while fetching data.

### **Use Case**

**Use Case Name:** Retrieve and Display Current Weather  
**Actors:** User  
**Preconditions:** User has accessed the weather dashboard.  
**Trigger:** The user enters a location and submits the input.  
**Flow of Events:**

1. The user enters a location (city name, or zip code) and submits.
2. The system validates the input format.
3. Tfhe system uses Nominatim to convert to latitude/longitude.
4. If the weather data is cached and not expired, the system returns weather data from the database.
5. If the weather data isn't cached, the system requests current weather data from Open-Meteo API using the coordinates.
6. The system processes and displays the current weather details.

**Alternative Flows:**

- If the location input is invalid, the system shows an error message.
- If the Nominatim API fails, the system prompts the user to try entering coordinates directly.
- If the Open-Meteo API fails, the system displays an error message and suggests trying again later.
