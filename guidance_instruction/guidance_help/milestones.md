### **🚀 How to Set Up Multiple Project Milestone Boards on GitHub**
GitHub’s **Projects** feature provides a **Kanban-style board** where you can track milestones, tasks, and progress.

### **1️⃣ Creating Multiple Project Milestone Boards**
You can create **multiple project boards**, each representing a different milestone, such as **Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Sprint 3**, etc.

#### **Steps to Create a Project Board for a Milestone:**
1. **Go to Your Repository or Organization:**
   - Navigate to your **GitHub repository**.
   - Click on **Projects** (on the top menu).

2. **Create a New Project Board:**
   - Click **"New Project"**.
   - Give it a name, e.g., `"Sprint 1 Milestone"` or `"Project Phase 1"`.
   - Choose a **template** (e.g., **Kanban**, **Automated**, or **Custom**).

3. **Customize Columns:**
   - Default **To Do → In Progress → Done** structure.
   - You can add columns for **specific milestone tasks** like:
     - **Backlog**
     - **In Review**
     - **Testing**
     - **Deployment**
  
4. **Add Issues & Pull Requests:**
   - Link **issues** (tasks) to milestones.
   - Assign **pull requests** to track development work.

5. **Repeat for Each Milestone:**  
   - Create additional project boards for **Sprint 2, Sprint 3, etc.**.

### **2️⃣ Managing Multiple Milestone Boards Efficiently**
✔ **Use Labels:** Tag issues with `Sprint 1`, `Sprint 2`, etc.  
✔ **Link Boards to Milestones:** Assign project boards to GitHub Milestones.  
✔ **Automate with GitHub Actions:** Auto-move issues between columns based on status.  
✔ **Cross-Reference Tasks:** Link related tasks across boards.

### **3️⃣ Example: Multiple Milestone Boards**
📌 **Project Boards:**
- 🚀 **Sprint 1 Board** → Tracks initial development  
- 🔄 **Sprint 2 Board** → Focuses on testing phase  
- ✅ **Final Release Board** → Final deployment and QA  

Each sprint has a **separate board**, tracking tasks independently but linked through GitHub **issues & milestones**.
