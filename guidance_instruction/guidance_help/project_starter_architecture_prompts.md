### Prompt 7
out of all the above which 4 are the easiest to implement for a project group of 3 - 6 allowing all to participate in each agile sprint and maintain version control and reducing conflicts.  These are 2nd year Community College students in a Software Quality Assurance course with experience in Python and will be learning flask as they develop the application used for testing. The primary goal of the project is Software Quality Assurance: Integrate robust testing practices in development workflows.
